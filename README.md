live555-CMake
=============

Mirror of LIVE555 Streaming Media libraries with CMake build files for Linux and Windows platform.

(Useful for Windows if you don't want to compile the live555 libs with nmake and prefer VS project generation.)
Current live555 version: 2015.12.22

Tested with VS2013 Express.

Note: not all test programs (testProgs/) have been added to the CMakeLists.txt. It is however trivial to add missing ones.
